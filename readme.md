# Instructions for Lab 1 fix for Digital Logic Lab 2017

As of Wednesday night, github classroom's bug was fixed. Everybody should log onto github.com and go to https://classroom.github.com 
to have github classroom app authorized. Once your account is authroized, the following instruction should guide you through to setup
assignment 1, and then you should submit assignment 1 as we have discussed in class.

## Team assignmnet

### Creating a team

Use the following instruction to create lab group:

  - There must be **only one** student from each group to create team.
    So make sure you communicate with your other group member to decide who is going to create a group.

  - Name your team name starting with prefix "DL2017F_", and try not to have any space in the team name

  - Go to your assignment page specified in the email.
    
  - Once you are there, you will see a page like this:
    
![accept assignment](pics/accept_assignment.png)
<!-- <img src="pics/accept_assignment.png">accept</img> -->

  - Enter your desired group/team name, and press "Create Team" button. 
 
  - Github classroom is still in beta, so some of its behaviors could be weird. After creating a team,
    you may direct you to a 404 page like this:
    
![invitation 404](pics/invitation_404.png)

Don't panic. All you need to do is to press the "back" button on your browser to go back to previous page,
and refresh that page. Then you should see confirmation page like this:
    
![invitation success](pics/invitation_success.png)

Now you can go to your assignment repository page by clicking on the link shown in confirmation page, or
go to https://github.com/BaylorComputerEngineering and your assignment link should be listed there.
       
### Joining a team

Once your partner tells you that the team is created, you can then join the team by going to the same
invitation link I sent you. Once you are there, you should see your team list above the creating team
option:

![Join team](pics/join_team_marked.png)

Join the team by clicking on "Join" button which might direct you to a 404 page like this:

![Join team 404](pics/invitation_404.png)

Don't panic. All you need to do is to go back to previous page by pressing "Back" button in your browser,
and refresh that page. Then you should see confirmation page like this:
    
![invitation success](pics/join_team_success.png)

Now you can go to your assignment repository page by clicking on the link shown in confirmation page, or
go to https://github.com/BaylorComputerEngineering and your assignment link should be listed there.

### Change Team

In the scenario where you accidentally joined the wrong team, email me your username and the team you are
supposed to be in.

## Assignments

Once you have successfully joined/created a team & accepted the assignemnt, you can always see your assignments
at https://github.com/BaylorComputerEngineering . The team creation/joining is one time only, so we don't
have to go through this again in the future.

Once you have access to your assignment, you should update the readme.md in lab1 as we have discussed in
class, i.e.:

- Clone the repo
- Make changes
- Add / commit your changes
- Push it back to github
- **Verify** your change by go to your assignment page to see if they are there

I want **both** of team members make some changes to the `readme.md` this time, even though the things you have 
change is only a few lines, just so that everyone can get familiar with the process. So what you can do is:

- One member clone, make changes, and push back to github
- Verify the changes on github
- The other member clone, make rest of the changes, and push back to github
- **Verify** the changes on github

Alternatively, you can also do:

- Both member clone the origin assignment seperately.
- One member make changes and push it back to github
- **Verify** the changes on github
- The other member pull the changes from github
- make changes and push it back to github 
- **Verify** the changes on github
- Member who made the first change pull from the github to get the second change

The second way can help you practice `git pull` command.

**Note**:
* Since we are just begin to use github, always **verify** your pushes by go to github.com to see it.
* In the future, I might omitt the add / commit in my comments, so when I say "make changes and push it", it
  always means that you need to make the necessary change, add the change, commit it, then push.

# Instructions for Lab 1 fix for Digital Logic Lab 2017

As of Wednesday night, github classroom's bug was fixed. Everybody should log onto github.com and go to https://classroom.github.com 
to have github classroom app authorized. Once your account is authroized, the following instruction should guide you through to setup
assignment 1, and then you should submit assignment 1 as we have discussed in class.

### Creating a team

Use the following instruction to create lab group:

  - There must be **only one** student from each group to create team.
    So make sure you communicate with your other group member to decide who is going to create a group.

  - Name your team name starting with prefix "DL2017F_", and try not to have any space in the team name

  - Go to your assignment page specified in the email.
    
  - Once you are there, you will see a page like this:
    
![accept assignment](pics/accept_assignment.png)
<!-- <img src="pics/accept_assignment.png">accept</img> -->

  - Enter your desired group/team name, and press "Create Team" button. 
 
  - Github classroom is still in beta, so some of its behaviors could be weird. After creating a team,
    you may land to a 404 page like this:

    Don't panic. All you need to do is press the "back" button on your browser to go back to previous page,
    and then refresh the page. You should see confirmation page like this:

    Now you can go to your assignment repository page by clicking on the link shown in confirmation page, or
    go to https://github.com/BaylorComputerEngineering and your assignment link should be listed there.
